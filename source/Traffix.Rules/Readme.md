# Traffix.Rules

Add support for Rule-based reasoning to traffix.net. 
[NRules](https://nrules.net/) package is used internally. 

This package supports an experimental implementation of context-based flow analyzer (InferFlow).

Rule-based systems provide the most commonn computational mechanisms of expert systems. 
Knowledge is defined in terms of facts and IF–THEN rules. 
The modus ponens is used as the underlying inference method to derive new conclusions from existing knowledge.
